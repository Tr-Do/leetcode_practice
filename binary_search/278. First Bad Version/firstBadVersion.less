# Problem
Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement

# What went wrong:
- Used left <= right
- Used wrong value: right = len(n)-1
- Off by 1 with right = mid-1
- Return right instead of left

# Approach:
- Binary search to find the first True -> lower bound
- Invariant: [0...left-1] == F [left...n] == True

# Time complexity:
O(log n)
